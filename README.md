# 💰 Expense Tracker (Full-Stack)

A minimal production-style full-stack Expense Tracker built with a focus on correctness, reliability, and real-world conditions.

This project allows users to record, view, filter, and analyze personal expenses with retry-safe API behavior and proper money handling.

## 💡 Design Decisions

### 1️⃣ Money Handling
Amounts are stored in the smallest currency unit (paise) as integers to prevent floating-point precision errors.

Example:
₹100.50 → stored as 10050

This ensures correctness in financial calculations.

---

### 2️⃣ Idempotency Support
The `POST /expenses` endpoint requires an `Idempotency-Key` header.

If the same request is retried (due to network failure or page refresh), the backend:
- Detects duplicate key
- Returns previously created expense
- Prevents duplicate records

This simulates real-world reliability patterns used in payment systems.

---

### 3️⃣ Persistence Choice
MongoDB Atlas was chosen because:
- Easy deployment
- Real persistence (not in-memory)
- Good for rapid development
- Suitable for evolving schema
